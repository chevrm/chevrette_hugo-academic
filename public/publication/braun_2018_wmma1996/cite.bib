abstract = {Micromonospora sp. strain WMMA1996 was isolated in 2013 off the coast of the Florida Keys, United States, from a marine sponge as part of bacterial coculture-based drug discovery initiatives. Analysis of the âˆ¼6.44-Mb genome reveals this microbe's potential role in the discovery of new drugs.},
