abstract: Resources available in the human nasal cavity are limited. Therefore, to successfully colonize the nasal cavity, bacteria must compete for scarce nutrients. Competition may occur directly through interference (e.g., antibiotics) or indirectly by nutrient sequestration. To investigate the nature of nasal bacterial competition, we performed coculture inhibition assays between nasal Actinobacteria and _Staphylococcus_ spp. We found that isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were sensitive to growth inhibition by Actinobacteria but that _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates were resistant to inhibition. Among Actinobacteria, we observed that _Corynebacterium_ spp. were variable in their ability to inhibit CoNS. We sequenced the genomes of 10 Corynebacterium species isolates, including 3 _Corynebacterium propinquum_ isolates that strongly inhibited CoNS and 7 other _Corynebacterium_ species isolates that only weakly inhibited CoNS. Using a comparative genomics approach, we found that the _C. propinquum_ genomes were enriched in genes for iron acquisition and harbored a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for siderophore production, absent in the noninhibitory _Corynebacterium_ species genomes. Using a chrome azurol S assay, we confirmed that _C. propinquum_ produced siderophores. We demonstrated that iron supplementation rescued CoNS from inhibition by _C. propinquum_, suggesting that inhibition was due to iron restriction through siderophore production. Through comparative metabolomics and molecular networking, we identified the siderophore produced by _C. propinquum_ as dehydroxynocardamine. Finally, we confirmed that the dehydroxynocardamine BGC is expressed in vivo by analyzing human nasal metatranscriptomes from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Together, our results suggest that bacteria produce siderophores to compete for limited available iron in the nasal cavity and improve their fitness.
