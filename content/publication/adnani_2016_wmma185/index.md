abstract: The _Rhodococcus_ strain WMMA185 was isolated from the marine sponge _Chondrilla nucula_ as part of ongoing drug discovery efforts. Analysis of the 4.44-Mb genome provides information regarding interspecies interactions as pertains to regulation of secondary metabolism and natural product biosynthetic potentials.
