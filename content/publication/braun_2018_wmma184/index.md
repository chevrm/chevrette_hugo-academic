abstract: _Dietzia_ sp. strain WMMA184 was isolated from the marine coral _Montastraea faveolata_ as part of ongoing drug discovery efforts. Analysis of the 4.16-Mb genome provides information regarding interspecies interactions as it pertains to the regulation of secondary metabolism and natural product biosynthesis potential.
