abstract = {Nonribosomally synthesized peptides (NRPs) are natural products with widespread appli- cations in medicine and biotechnology. Many algorithms have been developed to predict the sub- strate specificities of nonribosomal peptide synthetase adenylation (A) domains from DNA sequenc- es, which enables prioritization and dereplication, and integration with other data types in discovery efforts. However, insufficient training data and a lack of clarity regarding prediction quality have im- peded optimal use. Here, we introduce prediCAT, a new phylogenetics-inspired algorithm, which quantitatively estimates the degree of predictability of each A-domain. We then systematically benchmarked all algorithms on a newly-gathered, independent test set of 434 A-domain sequences, showing that active-site-motif-based algorithms outperform whole-domain-based methods. Subse- quently, we developed SANDPUMA, a powerful ensemble algorithm, based on newly-trained ver- sions of all high-performing algorithms, which significantly outperforms individual methods. Finally, we deployed SANDPUMA in a systematic investigation of 7,635 Actinobacteria genomes, suggesting that NRP chemical diversity is much higher than previously estimated. SANDPUMA has been inte- grated into the widely-used antiSMASH biosynthetic gene cluster analysis pipeline and is also availa- ble as an open-source, standalone tool. Availability:},
