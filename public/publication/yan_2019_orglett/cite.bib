	abstract = {Two new siderophores, madurastatin D1 and D2, together with (âˆ’)-madurastatin C1, the enantiomer of a known compound, were isolated from marine-derived Actinomadura sp. The presence of an unusual 4-imidazolidinone ring in madurastatins D1 and D2 inspired us to sequence the Actinomadura sp. genome and to identify the mad biosynthetic gene cluster, knowledge of which enables us to now propose a biosynthetic pathway. Madurastatin D1 and D2 are moderately active in antimicrobial assays with M. luteus.},
