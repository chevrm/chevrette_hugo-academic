abstract = {Micromonospora sp. strain WMMB235 was isolated in 2011 off the coast of the Florida Keys, USA, from a marine ascidian as part of an ongoing drug discovery project. Analysis of the {\~{}}7.1-Mb genome provides insight into this strain's biosynthetic potential, means of regulation, and response to coculturing conditions.},
