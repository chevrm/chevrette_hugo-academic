abstract: Once in a while, a conceptual or technical breakthrough changes the way we approach science. In microbiology, Leeuwenhoek’s lenses, Koch’s solid growth medium, Fleming’s penicillin, and Woese’s recognition of the 16S rRNA sequence as a universal chronometer all changed the way discoveries were made, each providing a new way to study or understand microbial life. Following Woese’s groundbreaking insight, Pace applied the polymerase chain reaction to the 16S rRNA gene, making it possible to characterize the molecular diversity of microorganisms in natural environments without culturing bias. The cascade of publications that followed made it clear that microbiologists were ignorant about the staggering diversity that had eluded detection by the culture-based methods that had dominated microbiology research since Koch’s 19th century innovation. Also made clear was the fact that many of the as-yet unculturable organisms were deeply divergent from those known from culture, presenting an opportunity to redefine the limits of microbial life. Pace then proposed that it was time to extract and clone DNA directly from environmental samples to conduct genomic analysis on the cornucopia of organisms that could not be cultured. This approach eventually became known as metagenomics—the analysis of collective genomes extracted from an environment. For the past 20 years, metagenomics research has primarily focused on sequence-based information and only a small proportion has been dedicated to functional metagenomics, which involves expressing DNA extracted from an environmental sample in a surrogate host to discover new metabolites and proteins. Functional metagenomics has been plagued by the hurdle of heterologous gene expression, and consequently, progress has been slow. Recently, Sugimoto et al. presented a game-changing approach to functional metagenomics that has the potential to revolutionize discovery.
